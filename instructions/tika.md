You don't seem to have Apache Tika installed on your system.

Apache Tika is used to extract text from PDF files.

You can download Apache Tika jar file from here: [https://tika.apache.org/download.html]()

Default location for the file is `~/local/src/tika/tika.jar`, but you can override it with the `TIKA_JAR` environment variable.
